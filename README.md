# Math Expression Evaluator

This is a simple web application for evaluating mathematical expressions and fetching interesting facts about the result.

## Features
- **Expression Evaluation:** Enter a mathematical expression into the input field and click "Result" to calculate the result.
- **Error Handling:** If the expression is invalid or cannot be evaluated, an error message will be displayed.
- **Callback:** After evaluating the result, a callback function is used to fetch fact about the result from the Numbers API. By using callback function we ensure that the process of fact retrieval will occurs asynchronously.
- **Fact Fetching:** After calculating the result, a fact about the result will be fetched from an Numbers API and displayed below.
- **Clear Functionality:** Use the "Clear" button to clear the all input field, result, and fact displays.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Math.js library for mathematical evaluation
- Numbers API for fetching facts about numbers
